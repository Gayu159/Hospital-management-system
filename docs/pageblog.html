                <h3>"Patient Testimonial" </h3>
                <p>"I came to WE CARE trying to recover from my Dialysis. I did not know the cause of my underlying issues as I've swept them under the carpet over the years, which was why I suffered in pain and escapism till my counsellor unravelled them and processed them carefully. WECARE has always made me feel safe because the staff there are professionally trained and recovering members are always there to offer their experience, strength and hope with one another. I was never happy or at peace because I was seeking perfection in life but today, I am living my imperfect life perfectly. Would strongly recommend WE CARE to people who want to recover and have another shot in life."</p>
